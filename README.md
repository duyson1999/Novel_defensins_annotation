## REQUIREMENT:
#### bash packages: blast
#### python3 packages: Bio, bioservices, pandas, os, multiprocessing, re
#### necessary files: whole genome sequencing in fasta format (change WHOLE_GENOME_FASTA variable in constant.py)
#
#
## RUN CODES:
#### query_seqs.py -> filter_seqs.py
#### Note: change *path variables in constant.py (local destination to save your result)
#
#
# ____PS____
#### This code can be used to annotate any gene on any target species genome (as long as they has their genome sequenced). However, user needs to change relative organisms list - relative_species.txt files for collecting reference proteins (depend on class of target species. Eg: black soldier fly -> class insecta)
