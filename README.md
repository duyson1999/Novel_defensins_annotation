# Novel_defensins_annotation
## REQUIREMENT:
### bash packages: blast
### python3 packages: Bio, bioservices, pandas, os, multiprocessing, re
### necessary files: "already-indexed" genome sequence from target species (using blastdb)

## RUN CODES:
### query_seqs.py -> filter_seqs.py
#
#
# ~~~PS~~~
### This code can be used to find every gene in every target species (as long as they has their genome sequenced). However, user needs to change relative organisms list (depend on class of target species. Eg: black soldier fly -> class insecta)
